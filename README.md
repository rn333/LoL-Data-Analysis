# League of Legends Binary Classification Model Data Analysis Project 

Purpose: To create a binary classification model with machine learning models. 

In this project, a variety of machine learning models were experimented with such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classification, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and XG Boost. Ultimately, the XG Boost model resulted in the highest predictive probability of 95.14%.
